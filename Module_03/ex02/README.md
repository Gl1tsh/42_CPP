### ex02: Repetitive work
**Objective**: Introduce a `FragTrap` class that inherits from `ClapTrap`. Implement additional functionality, such as a `highFivesGuys()` method that requests a high five. Ensure constructors and destructors have appropriate output.

**Expected Output**:
```bash
FragTrap Bob requests a high five!
FragTrap Bob attacks target, causing 30 points of damage!
```
