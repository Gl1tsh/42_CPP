# Exercise 02: HI THIS IS BRAIN

## Summary
Create a program that initializes a `string` variable with "HI THIS IS BRAIN", a pointer `stringPTR` to that variable, and a reference `stringREF`. The program should print:
- The memory address of the `string` variable.
- The memory address held by `stringPTR`.
- The memory address held by `stringREF`.
- The value of the `string` variable.
- The value pointed to by `stringPTR`.
- The value referenced by `stringREF`.

## Files to Submit
- `Makefile`
- `main.cpp`

## Compilation and Execution

### Compilation
```bash
make
```

### Execution
```bash
./hiThisIsBrain
```

### Sample Output
```bash
Address of the string variable: 0x7ffee7b3c690
Address held by stringPTR: 0x7ffee7b3c690
Address held by stringREF: 0x7ffee7b3c690

Value of the string variable: HI THIS IS BRAIN
Value pointed by stringPTR: HI THIS IS BRAIN
Value referenced by stringREF: HI THIS IS BRAIN
```
