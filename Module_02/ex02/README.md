# Exercise 02: Now We Can Talk

### Operators to Implement
- Comparison operators: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`
- Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Increment/decrement operators: pre- and post-increment/decrement.

## Files to Submit
- `Makefile`
- `main.cpp`
- `Fixed.{h, hpp}`
- `Fixed.cpp`
